## This is a fork of SimpMusic

This fork was created to fix a few issues that I encountered with the original application.

#### Current issues that this fork solves :

- Changed the shuffle behaviour of online playlists to fit with other music players.
- Fixed the app update popup even when the latest version is installed.
- Fixed a few app crashes.
